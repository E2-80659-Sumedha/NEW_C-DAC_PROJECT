### NEW_C-DAC_PROJECT

__Description :)__

  Now I decided to make my project with the help of NodeMCU and RaspberryPi in which I used two NodeMCU(ESP8266) on which I connected on one NodeMCU Temperature and Humidity      sensor(DHT11 sensor) and on other NodeMCU I connected gas sensor(MQ2 sensor). And both NodeMCU going to publish sensor data on MQTT broker here my MQTT broker is RaspberryPi.
  From both NodeMCU I send all sensor data on ThingSpeak for storage data.And NodeMCU also connected with LED and BUZZER if sensor data out from threshold value then buzzer and   LED gonna to on.
